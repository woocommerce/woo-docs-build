# Using the Code Snippets Plugin

## What is a Code Snippet?  

Customizing WooCommerce functionality often requires adding code snippets to modify behavior, enhance features, or integrate with third-party tools. Instead of editing theme files or the `functions.php` file directly, we recommend using the **Code Snippets** plugin from the WordPress.org repository. This approach ensures a safer, more manageable, and more organized way to add custom code to your WooCommerce store.  

## Why Use the Code Snippets Plugin?  

Editing your themeâ€™s `functions.php` file or adding custom code directly to WooCommerce files can lead to several issues:  

- **Loss of Custom Code on Theme Updates:** When you update your theme, modifications made in `functions.php` are lost.  
- **Potential for Errors and Site Breakage:** A single syntax error can make your website inaccessible.  
- **Difficult Debugging:** Managing multiple customizations in a single `functions.php` file can become unorganized.  

The **Code Snippets** plugin addresses these issues by allowing you to:  

- Add, activate, and deactivate snippets without modifying core files.  
- Organize custom snippets with descriptions and tags.  
- Avoid losing changes when updating your theme or WooCommerce.  
- Debug and test code safely before deploying to a live site.  

## How to Install the Code Snippets Plugin  

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.  
2. Navigate to **Plugins > Add New**.  
3. Search for **"Code Snippets"** in the search bar.  
4. Click **Install Now** on the "Code Snippets" plugin by **Code Snippets Pro**.  
5. After installation, click **Activate**.  

## Adding Custom WooCommerce Snippets  

Once the plugin is installed and activated, follow these steps to add a WooCommerce customization:  

1. Navigate to **Snippets** in your WordPress dashboard.  
2. Click **Add New**.  
3. Give your snippet a descriptive title.  
4. Enter your WooCommerce-specific PHP code in the code editor.  
5. Select **Only run in administration area** or **Run everywhere**, depending on your needs.  
6. Click **Save Changes and Activate**.  

## Example: Add a Custom Message to the WooCommerce Checkout Page  

```php
add_action('woocommerce_before_checkout_form', function() {
    echo '<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Reminder: Ensure your shipping address is correct before placing your order.</p>';
});
``` 

## Managing and Troubleshooting Snippets  

- **Deactivating Snippets:** If a snippet causes issues, simply deactivate it from the Code Snippets interface without affecting the rest of your site.  
- **Error Handling:** The plugin detects fatal errors and automatically deactivates problematic snippets.  
- **Backup and Export:** You can export your snippets for backup or transfer to another site.
