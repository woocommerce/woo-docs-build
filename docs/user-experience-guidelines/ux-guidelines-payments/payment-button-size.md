# Payment Button Size and Anatomy

Payment buttons must be consistent in visual appearance to other buttons in the shopper experience.

Height for payment buttons ranges from 40px (Small) to 55px (Large). The default button height is 48px. The following presets can be used for button height.

- Small: Height 40px
- Default: Height 48px
- Large: Height 55px

### Anatomy

Payment buttons consist of up to three elements: a button component, payment logo, and optional label.

Don't place any text outside the surface area of the button.

### Layout and spacing

The spacing between and around the Label and Payment Logo adapts based on the size of the button.

Make payment buttons the same size, no bigger or smaller than other payment buttons, including the CTAs "Add to cart" and "Proceed to checkout".

Follow the minimum width of each payment button size. Don't squeeze payment buttons in a single line.
