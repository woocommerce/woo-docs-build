Define the position and alignment of buttons in relationship to their container, with equal hierarchy and consistent spacing between buttons.

### Express checkout

Position payment buttons correctly in horizontal layout, consistent in size and spacing. If a second row is required, left-align the buttons.

### Mobile view

Express payment buttons on mobile should occupy the full width. Don't use the express payment border as it reduces the view area.

### Clear space

Maintain the minimum amount of clear space on all sides of the payment button. The clear space adapts based on the size of the button.
